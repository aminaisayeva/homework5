# API Data Display in Table

This project is part of my homework assignment for COMS3102. My name is Amina Isayeva, and my UNI is ai2464. The goal was to create a simple web application that demonstrates fetching user data from an API and displaying it within a table on a webpage using HTML and JavaScript.

## Overview

In this application, I utilized the Fetch API to retrieve a list of users from `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5`. I then dynamically generated a table to display each user's first name and city.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3, with Bootstrap 5.3.3 for styling
- JavaScript (ES6) for dynamic content

## How to Run

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the ZIP directly.
2. Then, navigate to the directory containing the project, specifically where the `index.html` and `script.js` files are located.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to see the application in action.

Upon loading the page, you'll see the table automatically populated with data fetched from the API.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: This file contains the markup for the user interface. It includes a table structure where the API data will be displayed.
- `script.js`: Here lies the JavaScript code responsible for fetching user data from the API and dynamically inserting it into the HTML table.
- `README.md`: Provides a project overview and detailed instructions on how to run the application.
